## 1. Summary
Our project aims to store and track data related to usersâ€™ fitness regimes. Users are composed of people looking to introduce an element of consistency and organization to their workouts such that they can clarify their progress and personal targets. The database models users, workouts, exercises, exercise logs, fitness goals, achievements, physical measurements, and gym locations.
